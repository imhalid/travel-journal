# travel-journal

I have successfully completed another mission. Again, I learned a lot about things. Really, most of the learning is practice. While watching the videos, I think I know a lot of subjects, but when I'm on my own, I find it difficult.

When I encounter a problem, it becomes more permanent when I research and solve it myself. and finally I record how I solved this problem in a notebook.

# Substances

- I think I learned how to use the map feature. (at least some of it)
- I learned how to take data from `json` file and use it with a `component`.
- I learned how to add a link. (simple but solved it with some research.)

```
ex: src / href={`${props.map}`}
```
